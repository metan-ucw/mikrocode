Mikrocode
---------

The Mikrocode is a build system as well as a library of common code for
microcontrollers (mostly for AVR family).

The build system is features are:

* Simple to use all that is needed is to set MCU type, path to the Mikrocode
  library and include the Makefile skeleton

* Tracks source code dependencies automatically

* Recompiles library for the target MCU in the project directory

The library itself contains common code for character displays based on hd44780
software one wire bus, ds18b20 thermomether, AVR bussy loop delays, eeprom
reading/writing rutines etc..

See simple example project in proj/blink or all example projects in proj/
directory for more.
